%
% LSPI : Least-Squares Policy Iteration
%
% Finds a good policy given a set of samples and a basis
%
% Input:
% 
% domain - A string containing the name of the domain
%          This string should be the prefix for all related
%          functions, for example if domain is 'chain' functions
%          should be chain_initialize_policy, chain_simulator,
%          etc.
%
% algorithm - This is a number that indicates which evaluation
%             algorithm should be used (see the paper):
%
%             1-lsq       : The regular LSQ (incremental)
%             2-lsqfast   : A fast version of LSQ (uses more space)
%             3-lsqbe     : LSQ with Bellman error minimization 
%             4-lsqbefast : A fast version of LSQBE (more space)
%
%             LSQ is the evaluation algorithm for regular
%             LSPI. Use lsqfast in general, unless you have
%             really big sample sets. LSQBE is provided for
%             comparison purposes and completeness.
%
% maxiterations - An integer indicating the maximum number of
%                 LSPI iterations 
% 
% epsilon - A small real number used as the termination
%           criterion. LSPI converges if the distance between
%           weights of consequtive iterations is less than
%           epsilon.
%
% samples - The sample set. This should be an array where each
%            entry samples(i) has the following form: 
%
%            samples(i).state     : Arbitrary description of state
%            samples(i).action    : An integer in [1,|A|]
%            samples(i).reward    : A real value
%            samples(i).nextstate : Arbitrary description
%            samples(i).absorb    : Absorbing nextstate? (0 or 1)
%
% basis - The function that computes the basis for a given pair
%         (state, action) given as a function handle
%         (e.g. @chain_phi) or as a string (e.g. 'chain_phi').
% 
% discount - A real number in (0,1] to be used as the discount factor
%
% initial_policy - (optional argument) An initial policy for
%                  LSPI. It should be given as a struct with the
%                  following fields (at least):
%
%                  explore  : Exploration rate (real number)
%                  discount : Discount factor (real number)
%                  actions  : Total numbers of actions, |A|
%                  basis    : The function handle for the basis
%                             associated with this policy
%                  weights  : A column array of weights 
%                             (one for each basis function)
%
%                  If initial_policy is not provided it is initialized
%                  to a policy with "explore"=0.0, "discount" and
%                  "basis" as provided above, and "actions" and
%                  "weights" as suggested by the domain (in the
%                  domain_initialize_policy function.
%
% Output:
%
% policy - The learned policy (same struct as above)
% 
% all_policies - A cell array of size (iterations+1) containing
%                all the intermediate policies at each LSPI
%                iteration, including the initial policy.
